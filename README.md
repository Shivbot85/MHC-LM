# MHC-LM
Fine-tuning Protein Language Models(Esm2) for Immunology 

In this study, we explore the efficacy of fine-tuning the ESM2 model for MHC peptide binding predictions. The approach leverages transfer learning, contrastive learning, and low-rank adaptation to improve model performance. We begin by fine-tuning ESM2 with MHC classification data, followed by further fine-tuning for peptide binding predictions. Additionally, we domain-adapted the ESM2 model specifically for MHC peptides and applied the same fine-tuning techniques to optimize prediction accuracy. Our results demonstrate the potential of these advanced fine-tuning strategies in enhancing the model's predictive power for MHC peptide binding.
